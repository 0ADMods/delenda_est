SIEGE WORKSHOP
- Build these to construct siege weapons and research their improvements.

- These types of siege weapons can be constructed here: Battering Ram, Bolt Shooter, Catapult, Fire Raiser, and Siege Tower.

- Not every faction will have access to every type of siege weapon. They are faction-specific.

- Field artillery can be unlocked here with the Military Engineers technology.
