# Check out 0ad.mod.io for the latest Delenda Est release for the official releases of 0 A.D.

## This repository is a work in progress and is not guaranteed to work with the latest "release" of 0 A.D. Rather, it is more compatible with the "SVN" or "Development" version of the game, which is bleeding edge.
